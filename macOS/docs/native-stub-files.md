# Native stub-file preparation

Fresh installs from a restore IPSW now prepare System, Data, Preboot and Recovery files in Swift after the verified APFS checkpoint. The backend advertises `nativeStubFiles: helper-files-v1`; its continuation validates the completed file receipt, hydrates installer metadata and skips its original `install_files` call. Firmware packaging and ESP/Linux partition population retain their existing path. OTA patch archives have no native patch-stream decoder: the stub preflight refuses firmware that comes only as one (`updateArchiveOnly`), and planning refuses it before approval. In the sealed policy that is the 14.8.3 entry, the last compatible one, and so the one selected, for every M3 Mac it lists.

The native plan selects the matching board/chip/device restore identity and preserves manifest exclusions, path deduplication and the boot-cache restore-directory fallback. Archive paths are admitted before target mutation. Files are streamed into private temporary files, verified through filesystem readback and atomically published without replacing conflicting contents. Large recovery images use native resource-fork compression; the filesystem's decompressed bytes must match the streamed digest before publication.

A protected binding covers the approved plan, source owner, target partition/container/group, selected manifest, source URL and member size/CRC inventory. Per-file receipts allow completed copies to be verified and adopted on retry. Incomplete files remain private and are retired only within that same plan and admitted target. Exact large HTTP ranges are cached with private checksum records; the cache has an 8 GiB cap and reservations for concurrent fetches, and it outlives jobs (see `NativeStubRestoreCache`).

## macOS free space

The cache and the decode directory live in the helper's working directory on the macOS data volume, so the stage needs free space there. `NativeStubStagingRequirement` mirrors the stage's own checks:

- Every cached range needs a 10 GiB floor plus twice its size free. The floor keeps macOS usable while files are staged. It belongs to this engine: the reference engine keeps its range cache in memory (128 one-megabyte blocks) and writes only small firmware files on macOS. So the stage needs the floor, everything it caches, and its largest range (8 MiB).
- What it caches is each read member's stored size, its 64 KiB prefix read, and every 1 MiB window that the member's local record and the body's last short range can touch, counted once.
- A decode of an Apple Encrypted Archive member of size `s` needs the floor plus `s` plus 8 GiB free once the member is staged. The decoder then writes its own copy of the input and the decrypted image, about `2s`, while it keeps the floor free. The 8 GiB is the largest member a stub plan admits, so it always covers that copy. Counted from the stage's start, a decode needs `10 GiB + 8 GiB + cached + 2s`. That is conservative by `8 GiB - s` against the decoder's exact need; the headroom also absorbs other macOS writes during a decode, which can take up to 30 minutes.

For the images in the sealed policy the stage needs about 11.5 GB for macOS 13.5 on a J414s (no encrypted members, about 0.73 GB cached), and about 23 GB for 26.6 and 26.6.2 (a 1.14 GB encrypted Recovery image).

The requirement is checked twice, both before the first disk change:

- **Planning** (`NativeStubStagingEstimator`, `MacOSStagingAdmission`) reads the image's directory, manifest and the restored members' prefixes, keeping small reads in memory. It adds the planning reads, the download still to come and a 1 GiB margin for the helper's own files before the stage (Recovery template, firmware ranges) and other macOS writes. It then refuses a plan macOS can't hold, or lowers the largest size of a macOS resize. The helper's APFS clones of the downloads share their blocks, so only their full-copy fallback, which the resize reserve already withholds, would need more.
- **The helper** computes the same requirement from the cached plan once every stage has preflighted (`requireStagingSpace`). It leaves out ranges an earlier attempt already cached for the image, and skips the check when the stage already completed. It adds the part of a macOS resize the partition map shows is still to come, so a resize that already happened isn't counted again.

Planning applies the check to free, resize and replacement plans. When the cap would fall below a recommended size, the largest size falls back to the candidate's own minimum before the plan is refused.

A floor reached during the stage is reported as what fetching the rest of the stage needs, not as that one read's need.

A shortfall at either point, or at any of the stage's own floors later, is a `MacOSFreeSpaceShortfall`. The notice reason is `macOSSpaceRequired`, with a summary such as "macOS needs 11.5 GB free to prepare the installation and has 8.9 GB. Free up 2.6 GB, then try again." Free space is `statfs` `f_bavail` of the helper's directory, which leaves out purgeable space Finder may count.

Encrypted image conversion uses the independently verified native decoder. It inherits the open journal lease as stdin, preventing a restarted supervisor from entering the same mutation while its decoder survives. Cancellation is forwarded and the owned decoder is joined or terminated. Stale derived output in the private per-plan decode directory is retired before retry; no second copy is kept in the stub. Source administrator metadata is copied from the verified source Preboot volume and protected against subsequent modification.

The native Recovery launch marker names the native app. Only the compatibility resource directory and relative native launcher remain at the old resource path because existing boot/ESP consumers still use it. No legacy Recovery UI is copied. Final native Recovery app/data staging remains part of the following ESP phase.

Source, synthetic restore-file and filesystem compression tests are separate from physical installation qualification. App-level restart/retry qualification, the complete native ESP/Linux stage, generic firmware packaging and portable radio policy remain required before end-to-end delivery.
